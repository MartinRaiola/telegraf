recommendations:
1. batch size should be large (e.g. 1000)


profiling:
telegraf to file 200000 points (100k spans) in 3 seconds

telegraf to influx not able to finish so far (buffering?)

Empirical results of default indexing vs. tsi

Default: finished in 11.278 seconds (2.7 user)
TSI: Didn't finish
TSI(master): 1:37 (9.3 user)

select * from zipkin where "id"='trace_id'
Default:  instantaneous
TSI: No data
TSI(master):

select count("duration") from zipkin
Default: ~1s
TSI: 30s

show tag values with key="service_name":
Default:
nearly instantaneous
TSI: Significant delay

show tag values with key="name" where "service_name"='trivial':
Default:
Nearly instantaneous
TSI:
Significant Delay

select count("duration") from zipkin where time > now() - 30m and time < now() group by "id","parent_id", time(1d):
Default: ~10 seconds
TSI: Didn't finish
